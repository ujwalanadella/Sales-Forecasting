# Sales Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict sales for a retail company using historical sales data and additional information such as oil prices, store details, holidays, and transactions. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and developing machine learning models to forecast future sales trends.

## Datasets
- **`holidays_events.csv`**: Contains information on holidays and events that could impact sales.
- **`oil.csv`**: Daily oil prices data, which may influence the economy and retail sales.
- **`stores.csv`**: Information about the stores, such as their locations and types.
- **`test.csv`**: Data provided to predict future sales.
- **`transactions.csv`**: Store transaction data representing sales volumes.

## Usage
### 1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ujwalanadella/Sales-Forecasting.git
```

### 2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
Navigate to the project directory and open the `Sales forecasting.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis and model development.

### 3. Explore the Project:
The notebook contains detailed data preprocessing steps, feature engineering techniques, and visualization of sales trends. It also covers various machine learning models used to predict sales, along with their evaluation metrics.

## Dependencies
- **Python 3.x**
