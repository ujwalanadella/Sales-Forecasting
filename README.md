# Sales Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict sales for a retail company by analyzing historical sales data, oil prices, store information, holidays, and transaction records. The project is implemented using a Jupyter Notebook with a focus on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model development.

## Datasets
- **holidays_events.csv**: Information on holidays and events.
- **oil.csv**: Daily oil prices.
- **stores.csv**: Store information.
- **test.csv**: Data for predicting future sales.
- **transactions.csv**: Store transaction data.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ujwalanadella/Sales-Forecasting.git
    ```
2. Open `Sales forecasting.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis and model development.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Results
The notebook includes various visualizations and model evaluation metrics used to predict sales trends effectively.
