# Sales Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project involves data analysis and visualization to understand and predict sales trends for a retail company. The goal is to leverage historical sales data along with other relevant datasets, such as oil prices and holidays, to build a model that can forecast future sales.

## Datasets
The project utilizes multiple datasets:
- **train.csv**: Contains historical sales data.
- **test.csv**: Contains data for predicting future sales.
- **oil.csv**: Contains daily oil prices, which may impact sales.
- **stores.csv**: Provides information about different stores.
- **transactions.csv**: Contains transaction data for each store.
- **holidays_events.csv**: Lists holidays and events that may affect sales.
- **sample_submission.csv**: A sample file to format your submission for the competition.

## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries are used in this project:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `polars`
- `scikit-learn`

To install the required libraries, run the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib polars scikit-learn
```

## Data Loading
The data is loaded using `pandas`. Here's how you can load the datasets:

```python
import pandas as pd

train = pd.read_csv("Data/train.csv")
test = pd.read_csv("Data/test.csv")
oil = pd.read_csv("Data/oil.csv")
stores = pd.read_csv("Data/stores.csv")
transactions = pd.read_csv("Data/transactions.csv")
holidays_events = pd.read_csv("Data/holidays_events.csv")
sample_submission = pd.read_csv("Data/sample_submission.csv")
```

## Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps include:
- **Combining the train and test datasets** for easier processing.
- **Converting date columns** to datetime objects.
- **Extracting features** such as year, month, day, day of the week, day name, quarter, and leap year from the date columns.

Here is a sample function to perform the datetime conversion:

```python
def datetime(df):
    df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df["date"])
    df['year'] = df['date'].dt.year
    df['month'] = df['date'].dt.month
    df['day'] = df['date'].dt.day
    df['day_of_week'] = df['date'].dt.dayofweek
    df['day_name'] = df['date'].dt.day_name()
    df['quarter'] = df['date'].dt.quarter
    df['is_leap_year'] = df['date'].dt.is_leap_year
    return df

df = datetime(df)
```

## Data Analysis and Visualization
Visualizations are created to understand sales trends over time. Key visualizations include:
- Sales by Year
- Sales by Month
- Sales by Day
- Sales by Day of the Week
- Sales by Day Name
- Sales by Quarter

Here's an example of how to create these visualizations using `matplotlib`:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

grouping_columns = ['year', 'month', 'day', 'day_name', 'quarter', 'day_of_week']
fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 2, figsize=(12, 10))
axes = axes.flatten()

for ind, column in enumerate(grouping_columns):
    grouped_data = df.groupby(column)['sales'].sum()
    grouped_data.plot(ax=axes[ind], kind='bar', title=f'Sales by {column}')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
