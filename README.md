# Sales Forecasting

## Overview
This project aims to predict sales trends for a retail company using historical data and external factors like oil prices and holidays.

## Project Structure
- **Sales forecasting.ipynb**: Contains the code for data analysis, visualization, and model building.
- **holidays_events.csv**: Dataset with holidays and events information.
- **oil.csv**: Contains daily oil prices, which might impact sales.
- **stores.csv**: Provides metadata about the stores.
- **test.csv**: Test dataset for predictions.
- **transactions.csv**: Transaction data across different stores.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ujwalanadella/Sales-Forecasting.git
   ```
2. Install necessary dependencies (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`).
3. Explore the `Sales forecasting.ipynb` for data processing and modeling steps.

## Data Sources
- **Train and Test data**: Historical sales data.
- **Oil prices**: Impact of oil prices on sales.
- **Holidays and Events**: Influence of holidays on sales.
- **Stores**: Store metadata.
- **Transactions**: Transactional data per store.

## Model Building
Details on the preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps are documented in the Jupyter notebook.

## Results
Analysis of the sales data, visualizations, and model performance metrics can be reviewed in the notebook.
